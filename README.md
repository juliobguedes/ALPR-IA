# ALPR - AI

The code in this repository was developed for Artificial Intelligence class Project.

Automatic License Plate Recognition is extremely important nowadays, and I am trying to develop a functional prototype of an ALPR application in Python 3.

All the code in this repository was developed by [JÃºlio Guedes](https://github.com/juliobguedes).
